## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the course of 4 Sprints, our team was tasked with developing WanderSync: A Collaborative Travel Management System application. WanderSync is simplifies the process of creating and managing travel itineraries for solo and group travel. Through this project, users can contribute to and refine travel plans in real-time. The Travel Management app allows users to organize locations, transportation options, accommodations, dining reservations, and personal notes. Secure account creation, an easy-to-use itinerary management interface, and real-time group planning collaboration tools are some of the main features. Travel information like destinations, transit times, hotel details, and food preferences can all be easily integrated by users. Additionally, the app allows users to create and share travel agendas, add and share notes, and synchronize updates across the entire group.
